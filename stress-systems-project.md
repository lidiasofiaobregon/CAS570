# CAS 570: Fundamentals in Complex Systems 
## Complex Systems Project: Stress and Social Interaction ~ Lidia Obregon

scientific question, convince them you made progress toward answering the question (i.e. add NetLogo documentation)

#### Big Picture Questions:
1. How do social interaction and stress relate to one another over time?
2. How do social interaction and stress interact to produce disease/health? 
3. How do individual differences contribute to disease/health within the population?

  create-turtles num_people [
    set shape "person"
